# Aqua Guardian

## Overview

**Aqua Guardian** is an innovative rehabilitation game designed to aid stroke patients in regaining hand and finger mobility. The game integrates with the Amadeo device, allowing patients to control an underwater diver who must navigate a series of caves and obstacles. The game is both engaging and therapeutic, providing real-time feedback and adjustable difficulty levels tailored to each patient's needs.

## Problem Statement

Stroke patients often experience significant challenges in regaining hand and finger mobility. Traditional rehabilitation exercises are repetitive and can lead to low motivation and engagement. Existing rehabilitative games do not fully address these issues, resulting in poor patient adherence. **Aqua Guardian** seeks to enhance patient engagement through a more immersive and motivating experience.

## Objectives and Methodology

### Project Objectives

1. **Enhanced Engagement:** Create a more engaging game experience to motivate patients in their rehabilitation exercises.
2. **Customizable Difficulty:** Implement adaptive difficulty levels that align with each patientâ€™s abilities.
3. **Targeted Rehabilitation:** Focus on specific finger movements to promote better overall hand functionality.

### Methodology

- **Data Integration:** The game reads real-time force data from the Amadeo device, which the patient uses to control the diver's movements.
- **Customization:** Game parameters such as the size and difficulty of caves, diver speed, and oxygen depletion are adjustable to match patient needs.
- **Visual and Audio Feedback:** Immediate feedback is provided to the patient through visual effects and sound cues, enhancing the therapeutic experience.

## Gameplay Mechanics

In **Aqua Guardian**, the patient controls a diver navigating through underwater caves. The diver must avoid obstacles, collect oxygen balloons, and reach the treasure chest before running out of oxygen. The game adjusts its difficulty based on the patient's performance, ensuring an appropriate level of challenge.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Environment:** The game environment is visually engaging, with realistic ocean visuals and animated diver movements.
- **Progress Tracking:** A progress bar keeps the patient informed of their current status and the distance remaining to the goal.
- **Feedback Systems:** Both visual (e.g., screen effects for collisions) and audio cues (e.g., impact sounds) are used to guide and motivate the patient.

## Instructions

To play **Aqua Guardian**, connect the Amadeo device to your system, and follow these steps:

1. **Configure Game Parameters:** Adjust the difficulty settings, select the finger for training, set other preferences using the GUI, and modify the cave settings via the provided Excel file.

2. **Start the Game:** Begin the session and navigate the diver through the cave's obstacle course using the Amadeo device. Be aware, oxygen levels decrease over time, as defined in the settings screen (Section 1).

3. **Monitor Progress:** Track your progress via the in-game feedback systems, including visual and audio cues.

4. **Damage/Healing System:** Take care to avoid damaging the caves, as each collision reduces your oxygen supply and spills blood. To gain oxygen, need collecting the balloons placed strategically throughout the course.

## Evaluation and Results

### Experimentation

The game was evaluated through trials with patients at the Beit Loewenstein Rehabilitation Center. Patients were connected to the Amadeo device and played **Aqua Guardian** after their functional levels were assessed. The game's difficulty was adjusted based on each patient's abilities.

### Feedback

- **Patient Engagement:** Patients reported higher levels of engagement and motivation compared to existing rehabilitative games.
- **Positive Outcomes:** The immersive and enjoyable nature of the game led to longer play sessions, which are crucial for effective rehabilitation.

**Aqua Guardian** has demonstrated its potential as a valuable tool in stroke rehabilitation. The game not only provides therapeutic benefits but also makes the rehabilitation process more enjoyable for patients.
